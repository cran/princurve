  * Updated DESCRIPTION: New version is 2.0.3
  * travis.yml: oldrel and release on osx and linux
  * Reimplemented project_to_curve completely in Rcpp, completely removing all fortran code from princurve.
  * Improved tests to ensure project_to_curve works exactly as legacy get.lam.

2018-06-12  Robrecht Cannoodt  <rcannood@gmail.com>
  * Updated DESCRIPTION: New version is 2.0.2
  * De-deprecate get.lam and principal.curve as not to break
    depending packages on CRAN. Will contact the authors to update
    their packages, as these functions will be redeprecated
    on 2018-07-01.
  * Rename get_lam to project_to_curve

2013-04-25  Kurt Hornik  <Kurt.Hornik@wu.ac.at>
  * DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.1-12.
  * src/sortdi.f (sortdi): Fix Fortran array bounds problem.

2011-09-18  Kurt Hornik  <Kurt.Hornik@wu.ac.at>
  * DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.1-11.
  * R/principal.curve.R:
  * man/principal.curve.Rd: Move whiskers() from code to example.
  * NAMESPACE: Added.

2009-10-04  Kurt Hornik  <Kurt.Hornik@wu.ac.at>
  * DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.1-10.
  * R/principal.curve.R (principal.curve):
  * man/principal.curve.Rd: Enhancements by Henrik Bengtsson <hb@stat.berkeley.edu>.

2009-07-15
  * principal.curve MEMORY OPTIMIZATION: Now the result matrix
  allocated as doubles, not logicals (as NA is), in order to
  prevent a coersion.

2009-02-08
  * BUG FIX: An error was thrown if 'smoother' was a function.
  * Cleaned up source code (removed comments).

2008-05-27
  * Benchmarking: For larger data sets, most of the time is spent in
    get.lam().
  * BUG FIX: smooth.spline(x,y) will only use *and* return values for
    "unique" {x}:s. This means that the fitted {y}:s maybe be fewer than
    the input vector. In order to control for this, we use predict().
  * Now 'smoother' can also be a function taking arguments 'lambda', 'xj'
    and '...' and return 'y' of the same length as 'lambda' and 'xj'.
  * Now arguments 'start' and 'stretch' can be NULL, which behaves the
    same as if they are "missing" [which is hard to emulate with for
    instance do.call()].
  * Added 'converged' and 'nbrOfIterations' to return structure.
  * SPEED UP/MEMORY OPTIMIZATION: Now the nxp matrix 's' is allocated only
    once. Before it was built up using cbind() once per iteration.
  * SPEED UP: Now the smoother function is identified/created before
    starting the algorithm, and not once per dimension and iteration.
